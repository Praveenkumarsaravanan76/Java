# Java Learning Repository 

This repository contains all my Java learning exercises and practice programs.  
I update it regularly as I progress through concepts from basics to advanced.  

## Folder Structure
- **java-basics/** → Simple Java programs (HelloWorld, patterns, loops, etc.)
- **oops-concepts/** → Object-Oriented Programming (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation)
- **dsa/** → Data Structures and Algorithms in Java  

##  How to Run
```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
